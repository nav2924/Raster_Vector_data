# GeoPandas Sample Program with Rasterio and Vector Data

## Introduction

This repository contains a sample Python program that demonstrates the use of [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/), an open-source project for working with geospatial data, alongside [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/) for raster data processing. The program showcases basic operations with vector data, such as reading, analyzing, and visualizing shapefiles, as well as integrating and manipulating raster data.

## Features

- **GeoPandas**: Handle and process vector data (e.g., shapefiles) with ease.
- **Rasterio**: Read, write, and analyze raster datasets.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Perform spatial operations, such as intersections, unions, and buffer zones.
- **Visualization**: Plot vector and raster data on maps for easy visualization.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the required dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nav2924/Raster_Vector_data.git

2. **Change Directory**
   cd Raster_Vector_data

## Data

- **Vector Data**: The repository includes sample shapefiles for testing GeoPandas operations.
- **Raster Data**: A sample raster file is provided for testing Rasterio functionalities.

## Example Output

Below are some examples of the outputs you can expect:

- **Vector Data Plot**:

- **Raster Data Visualization**:
